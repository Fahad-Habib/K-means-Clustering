# K-means-Clustering

K-means clustering implemented on IRIS dataset from scratch in python. Since it's a 2D clustering, so only the **Petal_length** and **Petal_width** have been used in this program.

## IRIS Dataset

The **Iris flower data set** or **Fisher's Iris data set** is a multivariate data set used and made famous by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher in his 1936 paper `The use of multiple measurements in taxonomic problems` as an example of linear discriminant analysis.
It has become a typical test case for many statistical classification techniques in machine learning such as support vector machines.
